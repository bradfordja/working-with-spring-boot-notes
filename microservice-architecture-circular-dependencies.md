## üß± Microservice architecture, circular dependencies
In a microservice architecture, circular dependencies between services (e.g., Service A depends on Service B and vice versa) can cause tight coupling, deployment bottlenecks, and complex inter-service contracts.

Here are the most common solutions to avoid or break circular dependencies:

‚∏ª

### ‚úÖ 1. Define Clear Bounded Contexts (DDD)

Use Domain-Driven Design to ensure each service has a clear responsibility and owns its own data.

üß© Example:
	‚Ä¢	UserService owns user data
	‚Ä¢	OrderService references user ID, but does not fetch full user info

‚∏ª

### ‚úÖ 2. Introduce a Shared Abstraction or API Contract

Use DTOs, interfaces, or OpenAPI specs to define contracts without tightly coupling services.

üß© Example:
	‚Ä¢	A lightweight UserSummary DTO is shared between services instead of full user entity.

Sure!

‚∏ª

### ‚úÖ DTO (Data Transfer Object) in Java Spring

A DTO is a plain Java object used to transfer data between layers (e.g., from Controller to Service, or Service to Client) without exposing internal entity structures.

‚∏ª

üß© Purpose:
	‚Ä¢	Decouple internal domain models (@Entity) from external representations (e.g., API requests/responses)
	‚Ä¢	Improve security, performance, and maintainability

‚∏ª

üß± Example:
```java
// Entity
@Entity
public class User {
    private Long id;
    private String name;
    private String password;
}

// DTO
public class UserDTO {
    private Long id;
    private String name;
}

// Controller returning a DTO
@GetMapping("/users/{id}")
public UserDTO getUser(@PathVariable Long id) {
    User user = userService.findById(id);
    return new UserDTO(user.getId(), user.getName());
}
```

‚∏ª

### ‚úÖ Benefits:
	‚Ä¢	Avoid exposing sensitive fields (e.g., passwords)
	‚Ä¢	Prevent tight coupling between API and persistence models
	‚Ä¢	Control data shape for different consumers (UI, mobile, external systems)

### ‚úÖ 3. Event-Driven Communication (via Messaging or Event Bus)

Use asynchronous messaging (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ, AWS SNS/SQS) so services don‚Äôt directly call each other.

üß© Pattern:
	‚Ä¢	Service A publishes an event (UserCreated)
	‚Ä¢	Service B subscribes and reacts

‚û°Ô∏è No direct dependency between A and B.

‚∏ª

### ‚úÖ 4. API Gateway or Aggregator Pattern

Create a facade or composite service that orchestrates calls to A and B, rather than having A call B directly.

üß© Example:
	‚Ä¢	UserOrderGateway calls both UserService and OrderService

‚∏ª

### ‚úÖ 5. Service Registry & Discovery with Decoupling at Runtime

Use a service registry (like Eureka/Consul) and load balancing, but abstract service contracts to avoid compile-time dependencies.

‚∏ª

### ‚úÖ 6. Split Shared Logic into a Utility or Library Service

If A and B need common logic, move it to:
	‚Ä¢	A shared library (use with caution)
	‚Ä¢	Or a new microservice (e.g., CommonService)

‚∏ª

### ‚úÖ 7. Avoid Direct Database Access Across Services

Never let Service A query or join directly from Service B‚Äôs DB. This creates tight data coupling.

‚∏ª

### ‚úÖ Summary Table

Solution	Description
‚úÖ Bounded Contexts (DDD)	Split domain cleanly
‚úÖ Event-Driven Architecture	Use messages, not direct calls
‚úÖ API Gateway / Aggregator	Central orchestration layer
‚úÖ Shared Interfaces/DTOs	Abstract and version APIs
‚úÖ Shared Utility Services	Extract common functionality
‚ùå Direct Service or DB Calls	Avoid tight coupling and circular logic
